# UD2TABLE
The [UDUNITS 2](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/) software facilitates unit conversions for physical quantities. It is based on an XML database that, while more human-readible than some XML, is not great for at-a-glance reference. Through the magic of XSLT, this repository generates an easy reference table.
